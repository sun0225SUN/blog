I once saw a comic called "11 Lifetimes."

Spend one lifetime writing poetry, one lifetime creating, one lifetime seeking truth......

If I can live to 70, I still have seven lifetimes left.

2023 was the first year of this lifetime.

This year, I bid farewell to campus life and stepped into the workplace. I left Anhui, came to Guangdong, and visited Tibet. I climbed mountains at dawn, saw the sea at night, cycled 1,500 kilometers in the southern weather. In distant Lhasa, I witnessed the magnificent Potala Palace and experienced the most devout faith.

## Bidding Farewell to Campus

2023 was the year my student life came to an end.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191634800.webp)

Time flies, and the scene of entering school is still vivid in my mind.

A young man full of hope for the future, dragging heavy luggage, arriving here late one night......

### Looking Back at College Life

Four years of university, many unforgettable moments.

In 2019, celebrating New Year's Eve with classmates from Surveying Class 2.

In 2020, participating in field practice with classmates from Geographic Information Class 1.

During four years of university, I visited some places: Hefei, Nanjing, Chuzhou, Shouxian.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191649199.webp)

I saw Xuanwu Lake, Tianmu Lake, climbed Shun Geng Mountain, Langya Mountain.

I experienced the human warmth of Huainan, this city.

I experienced the hardships of surveying fieldwork.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191650293.webp)

I also spent some sleepless nights studying programs I couldn't understand at all.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191650465.webp)

I left behind some beautiful and precious memories.

Searching for direction in the fog, exploring the world within constraints—this is how my college life was archived.

## Life and Health

In 2023, I lived in two cities: Hefei and Guangzhou.

Without life experience, renting, eating, and managing finances all became immediate problems. Only after truly settling down did I realize how difficult life can be.

### Three Months in Hefei

During the three months I lived in Hefei, I didn't go to many places. I visited Huaihe Road, walked through the cultural center, and climbed Dashu Mountain.

### Six Months in Guangzhou

During the half year I lived in Guangzhou, I visited Zhuhai twice, and Jiangmen, Huizhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, and Shunde once each.

I visited Canton Tower, Beijing Road, Shamian Island, Seagull Island, Nansha Tin Hau Temple, Xifang Courtyard, Shijiu Yong, Shuisheng Reservoir, Yatkou Coast. I climbed Baiyun Mountain, Huolu Mountain, and Danan Mountain. I ate freshly picked lychees and had dim sum.

In Zhuhai, I walked along Lovers' Road, witnessed Macau's extravagance, gazed across the sea at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, and photographed the beautiful Sun Moon Shell.

### My Weight Loss Journey

Life in 2023 was always on the road, and also on the road to weight loss and health.

Due to poor lifestyle habits, when I graduated in June, I looked quite bloated.

It wasn't until my weight reached 170+ pounds that I realized the seriousness of the problem.

I got a gym membership, kept running, controlled my diet, and got good sleep. In four months, I lost about 20 pounds and became much healthier.

### My Cycling Exploration

In my freshman year, influenced by my roommate, I bought a 500-yuan mountain bike and rode it for about half a semester.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191821112.webp)

Later, because of the pandemic, the bike was scrapped. In my junior year, I bought another Xidesheng bike.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191822166.webp)

Unfortunately, the bike was stolen during summer vacation. Then in July of this year, I got into a Giant flat-bar road bike.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191822204.webp)

I rode it to Zhuhai once, and then wanted to switch to a drop-bar road bike. In December, I sold it and got a Java bike.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191930086.webp)

Riding the "Java Torpedo 6-top," I've been to many places and created many beautiful memories.

### My Journey to Tibet

At the end of the year, I quit my job in Guangzhou and took train Z264 to Lhasa, a journey of five thousand kilometers.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191906327.webp)

I departed on the afternoon of the 24th, and after 53 hours, I finally arrived at the roof of the world.

In one week, I visited Lhasa, Shannan, Shigatse, and Nyingchi. I saw the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple, Yamdrok Lake, Karola Glacier, Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon, and Mount Namcha Barwa.

## Career Planning

Yes, just half a year after graduation, I quit my job. Why did I resign?

It wasn't really an impulse decision; it was more about my own career planning.

My current position is Web Frontend Developer, and I expect to remain in this field for a long time. Yet a year ago, I didn't even understand web development (back then, I was just interested in web development and had copied and pasted some code).

### My Internship at NIO

Never noticed the stars, haven't seen the sunset in a long time......

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191832280.webp)

I was a complete novice back then (still am now, emmm, but a bit better than before～).

To keep up with the "assembly line" of a big company, I needed to spend more time studying code.

That spring, apart from studying and working, I had almost no other time to spare.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191833887.webp)

Fortunately, I genuinely liked this work.

I'm also very grateful for this experience, which helped me see my future career direction clearly.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191834165.webp)

### I Love Frontend Development

I love tinkering, and development is all about tinkering. I love this industry.

During the pandemic, when I was quarantined at home, because I didn't want to take online classes, I started studying computers.

In the C language lab class after returning to school, I realized the powerful capabilities of this dark window. I rolled up my sleeves and prepared to study it seriously～

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191835333.webp)

The terminal was too ugly. Later, I wanted to add a graphical interface to programs, so I started studying C#......

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191836229.webp)

The things I wrote couldn't be shared directly. Packaged executable files needed to be installed, and sometimes wouldn't run due to environment issues. For various reasons, I completely lost interest in desktop GUI development.

I got into web development because of building a personal blog. From domain registration to website deployment, the simplicity and ease of use of web projects made me ecstatic.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191836603.webp)

### My Work at Tuhui

NIO didn't have headcount, so I had to find another path. By chance, I came to this company in Guangzhou, ready to make great strides.

But......

After working for a while, I found that the module division and system construction in small companies were indeed difficult to describe, so I had the idea of leaving early on.

![](https://files.guoqi.dev/images/202402191837945.webp)

### Working for Myself

At work, we all have two bosses.

The first boss is your supervisor. You follow requirements, complete tasks, put in labor, and exchange it for a salary......

The second boss is yourself. What kind of person you want to become, what kind of growth you want to gain at work, what goals you want to achieve—this is what this boss asks of you.

I actually quite like working, because at work I can gain growth—what's called working for myself.

Quantitative change leads to qualitative change. By self-driving and self-growing at work, and then achieving self-breakthrough and self-iteration, perhaps one day in the future, we can break free from the first boss and become people who only work for ourselves, or even don't work at all.
