I once saw a comic called "11 Lifetimes."

<div style="max-height:500px;overflow:auto;margin-bottom:10px;">
  <img width="100%" style="max-height:100% !important" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402170104110.webp" >
</div>

Using one lifetime to write poetry, one lifetime to create, one lifetime to seek truth...

If I can live to 70, then I have seven lifetimes left.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402192341747.webp"/>

2023 was the first year of this lifetime.

This year, I bid farewell to campus and entered the workforce. I left Anhui, came to Guangdong, and visited Tibet. I climbed mountains at dawn, saw the sea at night, and cycled 1,500 kilometers in the southern weather. In distant Lhasa, I witnessed the majestic Potala Palace and experienced the most devout faith.

## Farewell to Campus

2023 marked the end of my student life.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191634800.webp"/>

Time flies - the scene of my first day at university is still vivid in my mind.

A young man full of hope for the future, dragging heavy luggage, arriving here late one night...

### Looking Back at University Life

University life was full of memorable moments.

19 and I crossed the new year with classmates from Surveying and Mapping 2nd Class.

<div align="center">
<img width="50%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191636564.webp"/>
</div>

20 and I participated in field surveys with classmates from Geographic Information 1st Class.

<img  src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191648477.webp"/>

21 was the roaring campus grassland music festival.

<img  src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191648095.webp"/>

22 was the orange sunset in the campus library.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191648443.webp"/>

I visited some places in the past four years, including Hefei, Nanjing, Chuzhou, and Shouxian.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191649199.webp"/>

I've seen the Xuanwu Lake and the Tianmu Lake, climbed Mount Shunfeng and Mount Langya.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191649041.webp"/>

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191649903.webp"/>

I've experienced the hustle and bustle of Huainan, a city in Anhui.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191650474.webp"/>

I've experienced the hardships of surveying and mapping.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191650293.webp"/>

I've also researched some programs that I couldn't understand at night.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191650465.webp"/>

I've left some beautiful and precious memories.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191650618.webp"/>

I've been searching for direction in the mist and exploring the world within constraints. My university life is archived.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191650049.webp"/>

## Health and Life

23 lived in two cities, Hefei and Guangzhou.

Without life experience, renting a house, eating, and managing finances became immediate issues. It wasn't until I settled down that I realized how difficult life was.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191737516.webp"/>

### In Hefei for Three Months

In Hefei, I didn't visit many places. I walked around Huaihe Road, visited the Cultural Museum, and climbed Mount Daxia.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191738487.webp"/>

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191747516.webp"/>

### In Guangzhou for Six Months

In Guangzhou, I spent half a year. I visited Zhuhai twice, Jiangmen, Huizhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, and Shunde.

I've visited Guangzhou Tower, Beijing Road, Shamian, Haoyao Island, Nansha Tianhou Palace, Xifang Courtyard, and Nineteen Streams. I've climbed Baiyun Mountain, Huolu Mountain, and Daoshan Mountain. I've eaten fresh lychees and drunk early tea.

In Zhuhai, I've walked along the Lovers' Road, seen the glitz and glamour of Macau across the sea, and taken beautiful photos of the Moon and Sun.

### My Weight Loss Attempt

My life has been on the move in 23, and I've been on the path to weight loss and health.

Due to poor lifestyle habits, I was quite bulky when I graduated in June.

It wasn't until my weight reached 170 pounds that I realized the seriousness of the problem.

I signed up for a gym membership, stuck to running, controlled my diet, and got enough sleep. In four months, I lost about 20 pounds and became healthier.

### My Cycling Exploration

When I was a freshman, I bought a 500 yuan mountain bike from my roommate. I rode it for about half a semester.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191821112.webp"/>

Later, because of the pandemic, the bike was scrapped. I bought another Xidesheng when I was a junior.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191822166.webp"/>

Unfortunately, the bike was stolen during the summer vacation. Then, in July, I joined the Jianter flat-bar road bike.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191822204.webp"/>

I rode it to Zhuhai and wanted to switch to a curved bar road bike. In December, I sold it and bought a Jiawo.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191930086.webp"/>

I've left many beautiful memories with "Java Fish 6-top" as I've ridden through many places.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191823452.webp"/>

### My Tibet Journey

At the end of the year, I left Guangzhou and took the Z264 train to Lhasa. The journey was 5,000 kilometers long.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191906327.webp"/>

I left at 24:00 on the 24th and arrived in Lhasa after 53 hours.

In a week, I visited Lhasa, Shannan, Rikaze, and Linzhi. I saw the Potala Palace, Dazhao Temple, Ying Lake, Karola Glacier, Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon, and Namjagbarwa Peak.

After returning to my hometown, I spent a few days writing a 3,000-word travelogue to commemorate the journey. Welcome to read.

## Career Planning

Yes, I left my job after half a year. Why did I leave?

It wasn't just a sudden decision. More importantly, it was because of my career planning.

I'm currently working as a Web front-end development engineer. I expect to continue this for a long time. A year ago, I didn't even know about Web development (at that time, I was just interested in Web development, copying and pasting a little code).

I'm grateful for the help of a 贵人，and I came to Hefei's Nio for an internship in early 2023.

### My Internship Experience at Nio

I didn't think about stars, and I haven't seen the sunset for a long time...

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191832280.webp"/>

I was a real rookie at that time (I'm still a rookie now, emmm, a little better than before).

To keep up with the "assembly line" of big companies, I needed to spend more time researching code.

In that spring, besides learning and working, I had almost no time to spare.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191833887.webp"/>

Fortunately, I really like this job.

I'm also grateful for this experience, which has helped me see the direction of my future career.

### I Love Frontend Development

I like to experiment and develop. I love this industry.

During the pandemic, I stayed at home and didn't want to take online classes, so I started researching computers.

In the C language experiment class after returning to school, I realized the powerful capabilities of this dark window, rolled up my sleeves, and prepared to research it thoroughly.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191835333.webp"/>

The terminal is too ugly, so I started researching C# later.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191836229.webp"/>

Good things can't be directly shared, and the executable files need to be installed even if they can't run because of environmental issues. Because of various reasons, I lost interest in desktop GUI development.

I came into contact with Web development through setting up my personal blog. From domain name registration to website deployment, the simple and easy-to-use Web project, which can be used directly, made me very happy.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191836603.webp"/>

### At Tuhuo

Nio doesn't have HC, so I had to find another way to survive. By chance, I came to Guangzhou and planned to make a big splash.

But...

After working for a while, I found that the module division and system construction of small companies were indeed not satisfactory, so I had the idea to leave early.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202402191837945.webp"/>

### Working for Myself

We all have two bosses at work.

The first boss is your boss. You complete tasks according to requirements, work hard, and earn money...

The second boss is yourself. You want to become a person in the workplace, what kind of growth you want to achieve, what goals you want to complete, and this is the boss's requirement for you.

I actually like working, because in the workplace I can gain growth, which is also called working for myself.

Quantity changes lead to quality changes. Self-driving and self-growing in the workplace can lead to self-breaking and self-iteration. Perhaps one day, we can break away from the first boss and become people who work for themselves or even don't work.
