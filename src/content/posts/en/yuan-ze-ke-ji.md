At the end of 2023, I quit my job in Guangzhou and went to Tibet.

At the beginning of 2024, on the night before my 23rd birthday, I came across a job posting on X.

As I kept typing in Yuanze Tech's mission and values, I felt this was a great opportunity.

So I submitted my resume. I had the interview in the morning and received the offer in the afternoon. Perhaps everything happens for the best.

## Hello, Beijing

After an overnight train ride, I arrived in Beijing on the morning of March 1st, 2024.

This was my first time in Beijing, this city full of history and legend.

Fortunately, I have a very close college classmate studying for graduate school here, so we arranged to explore Beijing together on the 2nd.

We drank soy milk, ate noodles, and strolled around Jingshan Park and the Temple of Heaven.

Beijing's architecture is magnificent, giving a sense of grandeur and magnificence.

## Hello, Yuanze Tech

March 4th, Monday.

I walked `6.6km` and successfully arrived at the company at `9:57` in the morning. (The scheduled time for onboarding was `10:00`)

On my first day at the company, Miaomiao helped me register my personal information. In the afternoon, I spent time reading the company's <mark>knowledge base</mark>.

<blockquote>
<p>Society doesn't lack tools or professionals; what it lacks are people with both specialized skills and a holistic perspective. Not knowing something is fine—we can learn. But if we don't learn, how can we establish ourselves?</p>

<p>I hope you truly understand that here, there are no bosses, only classmates. We're just working together, and each person is responsible for both the company and their own growth, working to improve their abilities.</p>


<p>If each of us lives according to worldly constraints, maintaining life through inertia, then... this world would be truly boring.</p>

No bosses, only classmates. This is exactly why I chose the online name "Little Sun Classmate." Although I've already graduated from university, I will always be a student, because "one is never too old to learn."

Yuanze Tech's values align very well with mine. Xiaoli's previous products, ProcessOn and Mubu, are both products I really like.

Why is the company called **Yuanze Tech**?

Xiaoli wrote:

<blockquote>
<p>Whether in being a person, doing things, or running a company, we should all follow some basic principles to reduce mistakes. At the same time, we need to learn more and practice more to have a chance of making it to the end.</p>

Why **start a business again**?

Xiaoli wrote:

<blockquote>
<p>I'm an ordinary person. I don't want to work for someone else, so I chose to start a business. I know that most people don't want to work for someone else either.</p>

<p>They don't want to deal with a boss's attitude, they don't want to write daily work reports, they don't want endless meetings, and they don't want to do things they don't like day after day.</p>

<p>Some of them have already started to awaken, started to try hard, started to support themselves by making content on Douyin, Bilibili, and Xiaohongshu.</p>

<p>They are all warriors, daring to break conventions and be self-reliant.</p>

<p>They fail again and again, try again and again. At first, their income is low, and they persist through passion.</p>

<p>I want to make tools for them, do my best to help them. I've walked this path myself, tried several times, and I've been relatively fortunate.</p>

## Written One Year and Three Months Later

It's a pity I couldn't stay at Yuanze Tech longer. I left six months after joining due to the company's operational issues.

But this was the starting point of my entrepreneurial journey, and I'm very grateful to Xiaoli and Yuanze Tech.
