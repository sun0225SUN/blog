> I am a blogger, recording bits of growth and leaving some logs in the long river of life.

When I first started programming, I had a strong desire to write blogs. Summarizing it, there are several reasons.

- Once you enter the deep sea of programming, you always want to record what you have learned.
- A good memory is not as good as a bad pen. The knowledge learned yesterday may be forgotten in a few days. Blog == log, it can make my "tinkering" traceable.
- When looking up information online and seeing other people's articles, my inner OS: What is this? If it were me, I would definitely write better.

## My Blog Tinkering History

At first, I tried writing blogs on CSDN, gaining a lot of readers and followers, and feeling a sense of accomplishment (CSDN has now stopped updating, and I plan to switch to Juejin).

Later, I started tinkering with personal blogs. With zero foundation, I spent a few days building a static blog site based on Hexo + Github.

After some modifications, it finally turned into the following appearance (kept as a backup for remembrance, now abandoned).

During the preparation for the postgraduate entrance examination, the academic pressure was heavy, so I didn't have much time to manage the blog. After graduation, I plan to start over.

Since I have already tinkered with the static blog framework, why not try the dynamic blog framework?

After a short period of exploration, I finally chose to use the Halo framework.

Halo framework official website: https://halo.run

Halo is indeed very powerful, and it is free and open-source. It has received 29.6k stars on GitHub (data as of the publication date of this article), and I recommend everyone to use it.

However... although... but... emm... just last month, I returned to the Hexo framework camp.

## What Blogging Has Brought Me

### Passion

There is a very contrasting phenomenon in the blog circle:

The sites of the big guys are often very simple, and the content is very valuable. Most newbies, on the other hand, are more obsessed with spending a lot of time tinkering with the functions and styles of the site, and the blog content often contains a lot of water.

I think this phenomenon is very normal. I was the same when I first started blogging.

The output of knowledge is not a momentary burst but requires long-term accumulation. The meticulous polishing of the non-content parts of the website can better promote the blogger to produce high-quality content. "External beauty" and "internal beauty" are equally important.

Tinkering is for better output. Modifying the website and tinkering with functions increased my passion for technology.

### Social

When I first started tinkering with blogs, I only referred to official documents and modification tutorials. Later, I tried to join some chat groups, and the gears of fate began to turn...

When you encounter a bug, you can seek help in the group, and enthusiastic big guys will help you solve the problem. When you face choices, group friends will give you some constructive suggestions. In daily group chats, besides killing time, you can also learn some new things and break through the information cocoon (specifically high-quality group chats).

There was a time when "Akilar's Candy House" was a group chat I had to participate in every day. In it, I made many friends and met many big guys.

### Precipitation

When I was in school, I didn't have the habit of taking notes, and I even hated taking notes. I felt it was a waste of my time, and paper notes were not convenient to modify, polish, or format (mainly referring to high school, I tried and heavily used some electronic note products in college).

But writing a blog is completely different. You can modify it as much as you want, polish it repeatedly, beautify the layout, etc. (the most important thing is that you don't have to dislike your ugly handwriting).

Of course, producing a truly "content-rich" article is not easy and requires a lot of time and effort from the author. But precisely because of this, the things that are finally precipitated are more valuable.

In the boring work, encountering something interesting, I want to systematically organize it. In the laid-back life, I have some insights and want to record them well.

Organize the knowledge system and record thoughts and ideas. The things that are precipitated are the most valuable wealth in our lives.

## Blog Content Direction Thoughts

What exactly should I write in my blog? This is a question!

At first, I wanted to write everything, write about the new knowledge I learned, write my study notes, repost good articles I saw elsewhere, and copy some favorite sentences and texts.

But this brings a very serious problem, that is: chaos!!!

How to solve "chaos"? That is to do subtraction.

When rebuilding the blog, I screened some articles and left only about ten pieces of content. Most of these ten pieces are life essays and play guides.

In addition, I opened a new website to record my study notes, technical understanding, and summaries.

In this way, I feel much more elegant.

## In Conclusion

Writing this article was a spur-of-the-moment idea when I saw...

In this fast-paced, fragmented era, there are still a group of people who can uphold their worship of science and technology, cherish their longing for a better life, maintain the ability to think independently, quietly settle down, quietly change, slowly grow, and silently contribute...
