When I first started learning programming, I had a strong desire to write a blog. In summary, there were several reasons:

- Once you dive into programming, it's a deep ocean. Whenever I learned something new, I wanted to record it.
- A good memory is not as reliable as a written note. What I learned yesterday might be forgotten in a few days. A blog is like a log; it allows my "tinkering" to be traceable.
- When searching for information online, I saw articles written by others. My inner OS: What is this? If it were me, I could definitely write it better.

## My Blog Tinkering History

At first, I tried blogging on CSDN, gaining many readers and followers, which gave me a great sense of achievement.

Later, I started tinkering with a personal blog. With zero experience, I spent a few days building a static blog site based on Hexo + Github. After some heavy customization, it ended up looking like this:

During my postgraduate exam preparation, academic pressure was high, so I didn't have much energy to manage the blog. After graduation, I planned to start over.

Since I had already tinkered with static blog frameworks, why not try a dynamic blog framework?

After a short period of exploration, I finally chose the Halo framework.

Halo official site: https://halo.run

Halo is indeed powerful, and it's free and open source. It has received 29.6k stars on GitHub (as of the date of this post). I recommend it to everyone.

But... although... however... emm... just last month, I returned to the Hexo framework camp.

## What Blogging Has Brought Me

### Passion

There's a very interesting phenomenon in the blogging community:

The sites of experts are often very simple, with high-quality content. Most newcomers, however, are more obsessed with spending a lot of time tinkering with website features and styles, and their blog content is often filled with fluff.

I think this is normal; I was the same when I started blogging.

The production of knowledge is not a momentary burst, but requires long-term accumulation. Careful polishing of the non-content parts of the site can also motivate bloggers to produce high-quality content. "External beauty" and "internal beauty" are equally important.

Tinkering is for better output. Customizing the site and adding features increased my passion for technology.

### Social

When I first started tinkering with my blog, I only referred to official documentation and customization tutorials. Later, I tried joining some chat groups, and the gears of fate began to turn...

When you encounter a bug, you can seek help in the group, and kind experts will help you solve the problem. When facing choices, group members will offer constructive suggestions. Besides killing boredom, you can also learn new things and break out of your information bubble (especially in high-quality group chats).

For a while, "[Akilar's Candy House](https://akilar.top)" was a group chat I visited daily. There, I made many friends and met many experts.

### Accumulation

When I was in school, I didn't have the habit of taking notes, and even disliked it. I felt it was a waste of time, and paper notes were inconvenient to modify, polish, and format (mainly in high school; in college, I tried and heavily used some electronic note-taking products).

But blogging is completely different. You can freely edit, polish, and beautify the layout (most importantly, you don't have to worry about ugly handwriting).

Of course, producing a truly "content-rich" article is not easy; it requires a lot of time and effort from the author. But precisely because of this, what is finally accumulated is more valuable.

In boring work, when I encounter something interesting, I want to organize it systematically. In a laid-back life, when I have some insights, I want to record them well.

Organizing knowledge systems and recording thoughts—what is accumulated is the most precious wealth in our lives.

## Thoughts on Blog Content Direction

What should you write about in a blog? That's a question!

At first, I wanted to write about everything: new knowledge I learned, study notes, reposting good articles I found elsewhere, copying favorite quotes and texts, etc.

But this leads to a serious problem: chaos!!!

How to solve "chaos"? By subtraction.

When rebuilding my blog, I filtered some articles and kept only about ten pieces of content.

This way, I think it's much more elegant.

## Final Words

Writing this article was a spontaneous decision when I saw...

In today's fast-paced, fragmented era, there are still people who uphold a reverence for science and technology, cherish a longing for a better life, maintain the ability to think independently, quietly settle, subtly change, slowly grow, and silently contribute...
