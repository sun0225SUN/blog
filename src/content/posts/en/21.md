When we are born, we are initialized.

Our appearance and figure are our UI, and life is our core business.

Throughout our lifecycle, we need to keep learning, master various skills, continuously broaden our horizons, and meet more people and things. During this process, we will encounter all kinds of bugs, which we need to debug, fix, optimize, and even refactor.

But at the same time...

There are people we like and things we love in this world. Kindness and integrity, gentleness and thoughtfulness, humor and wit, contentment and ambition...

Life is both our client and our supplier. Each of us should be our own product manager, clearly defining the direction of every step forward, constantly achieving self-breakthroughs, and completing self-iteration.

Aimless and confused, when I realized I needed to truly plan my future, I was already 21.

But it's okay, I'm only 21, and the future is full of infinite possibilities.

Thanks to time for not abandoning me, bravely chase your own future!
