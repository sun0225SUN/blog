<div class="info-card">
  <p> In a world of information overload, what we lack is not information, but first-hand content that has been validated for value. The overly developed virtual world has made us islands, deeply trapped in our own information cocoons.</p>
  <p> The lack of offline social interaction makes us easily fall into our own survivor bias. The daily routine of work and life, always communicating with people of the same background, easily leads to tunnel vision, limited by our own technical perspectives and business understanding.</p>
  <p> Even when we meet friends online, it's usually just a few simple exchanges, making it difficult to have in-depth discussions about new technologies and new ideas. Crazy Saturday hopes to bring together friends from different backgrounds to exchange information and share perspectives.</p>
  <p> You can come from frontend, backend, algorithms, products, marketing, operations, or from art, music, industry, education, and more... To increase the time for everyone to get to know and communicate with each other, Crazy Saturday doesn't have a formal venue or host. The core activities are free networking, lightning talks, and roundtable discussions.</p>
  <p> The content shared can be in any form - it can be your project, new technologies and trends you're interested in, new trends you've observed, or even new ideas that are just in your mind. Anything you want to share and discuss with everyone is welcome.</p>

## Free Networking

First floor of Design Capital Building, Xicheng District, Beijing. I arrived at Kunlun Nest around noon.

When I first entered, I felt a bit awkward and didn't know what to do. But soon, the atmosphere ignited.

After greeting [Kaiyi](https://kaiyi.cool) and [Dashu](https://dashu.ai), I made a cup of coffee, sat down, opened my laptop, and soon someone came to "network" with me.

Soon after, [Smart](https://x.com/xchaigl) and [Uncle Wolf](https://x.com/i5ting) arrived at the venue one after another.

Uncle Wolf is really humorous offline, a super "interesting engineer". Just between us: <mark>Smart's phone font is really huge</mark>.

Around 2 PM, we welcomed [Xinbao Otto](https://x.com/xinbao965) (the event's speaker and host of the [《Web Worker》](https://webworker.tech) podcast).

## Lightning Talks

All guests were in place, with Kaiyi hosting, and the event entered the "Lightning Talks" session.

### [Kaiyi](https://kaiyi.cool)

Kaiyi's topic was "LLM! LLM! LLM!" - Large Language Models. Starting from paper rewriting, Kaiyi analyzed the characteristics of LLMs and the core value orientation of the LLM era, sharing survival strategies for the age of large language models. It was very insightful and beneficial.

### [Dashu](https://dashu.ai)

https://thesoulsland.dashu.ai

Dashu's topic was "Playing with Another Soul in the World" - an impressive "metaverse" website.

> Teacher Dashu once spent 182 days visiting 47 universities, 55 provinces, and 160 cities. With rich experience, he has many highlights in his career and life.

This website has many novel and quirky features. You can buy land, socialize, play music, and even hold meetings inside. There are also many easter eggs waiting for the community to discover (Teacher Dashu said he doesn't even remember some of the easter eggs himself, hahaha).

### [Acui](https://x.com/cuixr1314)

https://julebu.co

Teacher Acui's topic was "How to Build Your Own Product from Zero to One".

Earthworm is an open-source, collaborative, user-friendly English learning tool. From having an idea to starting development, to rapid user growth and scaling, user feedback, and community interaction, Teacher Acui perfectly demonstrated the process from 0 to 1.

The entire sharing was full of practical insights, providing great reference value for groups like "freelancers", "independent developers", and "super individuals".

### [Xinbao](https://x.com/xinbao965)

https://www.yuque.com/xinbao37/learn/mob8zk816xmqhih8

Xinbao's topic was "Why Do People Say Astro is Great?"

"Coach, I want to learn", "Reigniting the light of HTML+CSS is our duty".

### [Jingliu](https://space.bilibili.com/23372292)

Teacher Jingliu's topic was "Self-Healing for Workers".

> This video took 3 months to shoot. During this time, I felt the changes of seasons more deeply - trees sprouting and becoming lush, willow catkins floating on the streets, light shining on the lawn. The recovery of my ability to feel brought me much genuine joy.
>
> The biggest gain from shooting this video might be accumulating some inner strength, being able to maintain love for life and resist those negative things from the outside world.

Love can withstand the long years. Being able to enjoy the present and love life is itself a very happy thing.

> A personal note: Little Sun is also passionate about life.

### Yafang

Teacher Yafang's topic was "2024 AI Technology Trends & AIGC Application Trends".

Artificial intelligence is really hot right now, and Teacher Yafang's content was high-energy throughout. Welcome to follow "Machine Heart" to learn more about the latest AI news.

### Wang Yi

Teacher Wang Yi mainly shared his own career experience and thoughts, from photography to software development - truly a very cool thing.

### Yongwang

Teacher Yongwang's topic was "A Programmer's Survival Guide" - Real estate is not a human necessity, immortality is.

With his witty and humorous speaking style, meticulous thinking logic, and rigorous data support, Teacher Yongwang provided excellent reference for programmers' health.

### [Uncle Wolf](https://x.com/i5ting)

Uncle Wolf closed the show, sharing the topic "Technical Practices for Independent Developers".

From many dimensions and perspectives, Uncle Wolf pointed the way forward for "independent developers" and provided relevant technical guidance, full of practical insights.

### Roundtable Discussion

After the talks, the event entered the roundtable discussion session.

I sat at a table with Xinbao, met several new big shots, and Cell also arrived at the venue at this time.

## Interesting Souls Will Eventually Meet

Since graduating from university, I've joined many discussion groups - technology-related, blog-related, career-related, hobby-related, and more.

Back when I graduated, I even created my own learning and exchange group - "Little Sun and His Friends" (the group name was inspired by "Luo Yonghao and His Friends").

But...

It wasn't until recently that I realized that too much information only increases the cost of filtering "truly valuable information".

More groups isn't necessarily better. We should do more valuable things (like participating in offline events like "Crazy Saturday"?)

## Web Worker Offline Meetup

In the evening, I had barbecue with Xinbao, Smart, and Kaiyi, and over drinks we talked a lot about podcast-related things.

Web Worker is also hosting an offline meetup at the end of this month. Interesting souls will eventually meet - let's look forward to it～
