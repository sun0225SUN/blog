## Goodbye, Campus

The dust has settled on the 2023 postgraduate entrance exam. Some are actively preparing for interviews, while others are hurriedly sending out resumes.

At this stage, it seems everyone is a bit anxious. But facing the uncertainty of the future, we seem powerless.

As for me, I decided to leave campus and face the uncertainty of the future head-on.

## Hello, "NIO"

Not a CS major, still an undergraduate, never tormented by rote memorization or algorithms, yet I arrived at "NIO".

It sounds almost unbelievable, but fate truly brought me here.

After working at NIO for a week, I am certain this is the future I want.

## Happy 22nd Birthday

At 22, I will devote myself wholeheartedly and passionately to the career I love.

To refine my character, to deepen my skills, to create value!

    <strong>生命就是等待正确的行动时机。</strong><br>
