During the New Year's holiday, Yu and I finally made it to our long-planned destination: Zhuhai.

We departed on schedule at 8:30 AM. After about 4 hours, we successfully arrived at our booked hotel.

After a brief rest, we headed to a nearby village for lunch.

The courtyard's ambiance was excellent, reminiscent of "Youfeng Courtyard" (though this isn't Dali)

For lunch, we had "Iron Pot Ginger and Scallion Chicken," though it was just average (suddenly missing hometown stews and pancakes ðŸ¥¹)

After lunch, we returned to the hotel to rest. At 17:30, we were set to depart for the sea ðŸŒŠ

Around 19:00, we successfully reached Lovers' Road (I must complain about this section in Xiangzhou District - it was really rough ðŸ˜­)

From Lovers' Road, you can see the Zhuhai Grand Theater in the distance (the Sun and Moon Bay doesn't photograph well at night, so here's an old photo ðŸ«£)

At Xianglu Bay Beach, after chatting with some outgoing kids (who knew a lot about road bikes despite not owning any ðŸ«¡), we visited the "Fisher Girl Statue" and "Love Post Office."

Around 20:00, we had hotpot at "Three Bulls" (it was so delicious that we forgot to take photos while eating ðŸ¤¤)

On our way back, we took a break at "Haitian Park Beach" (the view here was amazing, with perfect cinematic vibes)

## December 31, 2023

At 10:00 AM, we had dim sum at "Baotang Tea House," experiencing the vibrant Lingnan culture.

After dim sum, we headed to "New Yuan Ming Palace" (built as a 1:1 scale replica of 18 scenes from the original 40 scenes of Beijing's Old Summer Palace)

<img width="360px" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202401022346412.webp" />

Around 14:40, we reached the "Macau Viewing Platform" (unfortunately, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge was hidden in the thick fog)

At 15:30, we waited for the fog to clear at "Muse Coffee" (the cafÃ© had an artistic dÃ©cor, and I was fortunate to taste Yu's hand-made coffee)

The fog never cleared, so we decided to ride to the artificial island to see the "Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge" up close.

At 21:30, we had all-you-can-eat BBQ at "Han Yang Ting," then headed to Zhongshan for the night.

In the early hours, we finally reached our hotel, with the sound of firecrackers and cheers coming from outside.

## January 1, 2024

On the first day of the new year, I had planned to meet [Simon](https://github.com/Simon-He95), so I needed to return to Guangzhou earlier.

<img width="500px" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202401030025532.webp" />

At this point, my destination was about 90 km away. Leaving at 7 AM would easily get me there before noon.

However... since I was up early (actually, I hadn't slept), why not watch the sunrise?

<img width="500px" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202401030026978.webp" />

Zhongshan has two perfect spots for watching the sunrise: "Lion Head Mountain" and "Yakou Coast." But... neither was on my route.

Even though it wasn't on the way... I still chose to go, and so...

<img width="360px" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202401030031771.webp" />

Leaving Yakou, I checked the time - 8:09 AM. The destination was exactly 100 km away.

Theoretically, without counting rest stops and red lights, I only needed to maintain an average speed of 25+ km/h to make it before noon. So...

After pushing to my limits, I had to compromise (a section of National Highway 228 was in terrible condition).

Finally, I rode to Nansha and called a cargo van.

In the end, I successfully met Simon around 12:30, and we had a pleasant casual chat.

## Afterword

Over these three New Year's days, we cycled more than 350 kilometers. This was both a journey and a spiritual practice.

Thanks to [Yu](https://github.com/ddy-ddy) for the careful planning that made this journey rich, precious, and unforgettable.

Thanks to my brave self, who can set out anytime, anywhere, regardless of everything - to feel the wind, listen to the sea, touch and arrive.
