When we are born, we are initialized.

Our appearance and physique are our UI, life is our core business.

Throughout our lifecycle, we need to constantly learn, master various skills, continuously grow our experiences, and encounter more people and events.

Along the way, we encounter various bugs that need constant debugging, fixing, optimizing, and even refactoring.

But at the same time, this world has people we love and things we are passionate about.

Life is both our client and our contractor.

Kind and upright, gentle and considerate, witty and humorous, content yet ambitious...

We should all become our own product managers, clearly seeing the direction of each step forward, constantly achieving self-breakthrough and completing self-iteration.

In a daze, by the time I realized I needed to seriously plan my future, I was already 21.

But it's okay, I'm only 21, and the future is full of infinite possibilities.

Thankful that time hasn't abandoned me, let's bravely chase our future!

Happy 21st birthday to myself ðŸŽ‚, life is worth loving
