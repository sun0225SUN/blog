I attended two offline exchange events over the weekend.

The "Pizza Party" by MiraclePlus on 3.15 and the "Crazy Saturday" by Kunlun Nest on 3.16.

## Pizza Party

The MiraclePlus event was brought to me by Cellinlab, and it was the first offline exchange event I attended since I came to Beijing.

The special guests for this event were "Hu Yating" and "Yin Dongxun", both of whom are industry giants and heavyweight figures.

### Summary of Gains

The pizza was really delicious (forgive me for being too weak, the sharing from the giants is worth listening to in person).

## Crazy Saturday

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180631507.webp"/>

> In a world of information overload, what is lacking is not information, but first-hand content that has been verified for value. The overly developed virtual world has made us islands, trapped in our own information cocoons.
>
> The lack of offline social interactions makes it easy for us to fall into our own survivor bias, working and living in a two-point-one-line routine every day, communicating with people with the same background, making it easy to be short-sighted and limited by our own technical vision and business understanding.
>
> Even if we meet some friends online, it is usually just a few simple communications, making it difficult to deeply discuss new technologies and new ideas. Crazy Saturday hopes to provide an opportunity for friends from different backgrounds to gather together to exchange information and share views.
>
> You can come from front-end, back-end, algorithms, products, marketing, operations, or from art, music, industry, education, etc... To increase the time for everyone to get to know each other and communicate, Crazy Saturday does not have a venue or a host. The core sessions are free chatting, lightning talks, and roundtable discussions.
>
> The sharing content can be in any form, it can be your project, new technology or trend you are interested in, new trends you have observed, or even new ideas that are just in your mind. Anything you want to share with everyone and discuss with everyone can be shared.

### Free Chatting

I arrived at Kunlun Nest at 12:38 on the first floor of the Design Capital Building in Xicheng District, Beijing.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180633265.webp"/>

As a socially anxious person, I was a bit nervous when I first went in, not knowing what to do. But soon, the atmosphere heated up.

After greeting Kaiyi and Dashuai, I made a cup of coffee, sat down, opened my computer, and soon someone came to "chat".

We introduced ourselves, exchanged views, shared experiences and thoughts, and a wonderful connection was established at that moment.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180633111.webp"/>

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180633800.webp"/>

Soon, XSmart and Uncle Wolf arrived at the venue. Uncle Wolf is really humorous offline, a very "interesting engineer".

> Whisper: XSmart's phone font is really large, hahaha.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180634212.webp"/>

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180634767.webp"/>

Finally, at around 2:10 pm, we welcomed Xinbao Otto (the guest speaker of this event, one of the founders of my favorite podcast "Web Worker").

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180635382.webp"/>

### Lightning Talks

All the guests were in place, Kaiyi hosted, and the event entered the "Lightning Talks" session.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180635380.webp"/>

### Kaiyi

Kaiyi's sharing topic was "LLM! LLM! LLM!", Large Language Models.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180637277.webp"/>

Starting from paper reduction, Kaiyi analyzed the characteristics of LLM and the core value orientation of the LLM era, sharing the way to survive in the era of large language models.

Gained a lot, benefited a lot.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180638914.webp"/>

### Dashuai

Dashuai's sharing topic was "Playing with Another Soul in the World".

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180638131.webp"/>

> Dashuai once clocked in 47 universities, 55 provinces, and 160 cities in 182 days. He has a lot of highlights in his career and life.

Dashuai's sharing content was an amazing "metaverse" work.

https://thesoulsland.dashu.ai

This website has many novel and interesting ways to play. You can buy land, socialize, play music, and even hold meetings. There are many Easter eggs waiting for the community to discover (Dashuai said he doesn't even remember some of the Easter eggs, hahaha).

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180639004.webp"/>

### A Cui

A Cui's sharing topic was "How to Build Your Own Product from Zero to One".

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180640865.webp"/>

https://earthworm.cuixueshe.com

earthworm is an open-source, collaborative, user-friendly English learning tool.

From having an idea to starting to do it, to the surge in users and scaling up, user feedback, and community communication, A Cui perfectly practiced the process from 0 to 1.

The sharing content was full of dry goods, providing great reference value and significance for groups such as "freelancers", "independent developers", and "super individuals".

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180641373.webp"/>

### Xinbao

Xinbao's sharing topic was "Why Do People Say Astro is Good?"

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180642382.webp"/>

Xinbao used a mind map to clearly explain the various advantages of Astro.

### Jingliu

Jingliu's sharing topic was "Self-Healing for Workers".

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180644444.webp"/>

The unique healing method of the giant, shooting documentaries, is really cool!

> This film took 3 months to shoot. During this period, I felt the change of seasons more deeply, the budding and thickening of trees, the floating catkins on the streets, the light shining on the lawn, and the recovery of perception brought me a lot of inner joy.
>
> The biggest gain from shooting this film may be that I have accumulated some inner strength, able to maintain my love for life, and fight against those negative things outside.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180644930.webp"/>

Loving life can resist the long years. Being able to enjoy the present and love life is a very happy thing in itself.

> A little personal note, Xiao Sun also loves life.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180645605.webp"/>

### Yafang

Yafang's sharing topic was "2024 AI Technology Trends & AIGC Application Trends".

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180645031.webp"/>

Artificial intelligence is really hot, and Yafang's sharing content was also full of energy. Welcome everyone to follow "Machine Heart" to learn more about the latest AI news.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180646594.webp"/>

### Wang Yi

Wang Yi mainly shared his own career experience and thoughts, from photography to software development, which is really a very cool thing.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180646912.webp"/>

On the last page of the PPT, Wang Yi shared a photo with the audience.

> Inspired by the monolith, an ape-man suddenly picks up a bone and smashes another creature's skullâ€”humanity's path to the cosmic stage is paved with blood.
>
> â€”â€”1968 Stanley Kubrick "2001: A Space Odyssey"

Making good use of tools to improve efficiency, bravely breaking the information cocoon, subtly changing oneself, the future is promising...

### Yongwang

Yongwang's sharing topic was "Programmer's Survival Guide"â€”Real estate is not a human necessity, immortality is.

Yongwang used his humorous speaking style, meticulous thinking logic, and rigorous data support to provide good references for the health of programmer friends.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180647973.webp"/>

### Uncle Wolf

Uncle Wolf was the last to speak, sharing the topic "Independent Developer Technical Practice".

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180648580.webp"/>

Uncle Wolf started from many dimensions and angles, pointing out the direction and providing relevant technical guidance for "independent developers", full of dry goods.

### Roundtable Discussion

After the talks, the event entered the roundtable discussion session.

I sat at a table with Xinbao, met a few new giants, and Cellinlab also arrived at the venue at this time.

## Interesting Souls Will Eventually Meet

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180650979.webp"/>

Kaiyi is the initiator of "Crazy Saturday" and the main organizer of this event.

The success of the event is inseparable from Kaiyi's hard work (of course, it is also inseparable from the efforts of all the staff of Kunlun Nest).

### How I Met Kaiyi

I met Kaiyi in the "Web Worker" listener group when he was promoting VisActor.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180650572.webp"/>
<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180650655.webp"/>

At that time, I happened to be very interested in visualization tool libraries, so I visited the VisActor official website to study it carefully.

Out of professional ethics (OCD), I found a small style issue on the VisActor website, so I added Kaiyi's WeChat.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180651801.webp"/>

Later, when Kaiyi started operating X, I realized that he was the author of Qwerty Learner (I had starred this project a long time ago).

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180651276.webp"/>
<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180651597.webp"/>

Fate is a thin thread, and later I also received beautiful stickers from Kaiyi's Qwerty Learner project.

### Loyal Listener of Web Worker

Near the end of my university graduation, I discovered xLog while browsing GitHubâ€”a creative community written on the blockchain.

Many giants were writing blogs on xLog, and I thought this project was very cool (although I didn't understand blockchain and Web3 at all).

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180652331.webp"/>

The author of xLog is DIYgod, this giant is really awesome, he successfully stimulated my curiosity.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180653181.webp"/>

At that time, YY happened to be collaborating with "Web Worker", and it was then that I first came into contact with this podcast. After that, I became a loyal listener of "Web Worker".

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180653075.webp"/>

### My Social Exploration After University Graduation

#### Listener Group

The Web Worker listener group is full of giants, with many giants from various fields in the internet industry.

I have obtained a lot of high-quality information, learned a lot, and met many giants and seniors in it.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180654953.webp"/>

#### Twitter

The circle of friends is not a very ideal social channel, so after graduating from university, I started playing X.

At first, I didn't think much about it, just to share life, thoughts, or complaints. Later, I found that X is actually a very good platform (details are not suitable to say more).

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180654930.webp"/>

#### Exchange Groups

Since university, I have joined many exchange groups, including those related to technology, blogs, careers, hobbies, etc.

When I graduated, I also created my own study exchange groupâ€”"Xiao Sun and His Friends" (the group name is borrowed from "Lao Luo and His Friends").

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180655573.webp"/>

> But... it wasn't until recently that I realized that too much information would only increase the cost of filtering "truly valuable information".
>
> It's not about joining as many groups as possible, we should do more valuable things (such as participating in offline activities like "Crazy Saturday"?)

### Interesting People Will Eventually Meet, No One is an Island

Because of listening to podcasts, chatting in groups, tweeting, blogging, and offline socializing, I have met many giants.

They have given me a lot of feedback, directly or indirectly, guiding me to move forward. I am really grateful for their support and encouragement.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403180656588.webp"/>

The collision of thoughts and the power of social interactions, interesting souls will eventually meet. "Crazy Saturday", no one is an island~

## Web Worker Offline Exchange Meeting

In the evening, I had a barbecue with Xinbao, XSmart, and Kaiyi, and talked a lot about the podcast.

Web Worker will also hold an offline exchange meeting at the end of this month. Interesting souls will eventually meet, let's wait and see~
