I'm fortunate that at the age of 20, I found something I could love for a lifetime - programming.

The binary combinations of 0s and 1s drive the progress of our era, with code harboring the power to change the world.

However... my journey of exploration hasn't been smooth sailing. But I never thought about giving up, never considered ending it carelessly.

Although I've only been self-learning for ten months, along the way, I've met many teachers who shared their knowledge generously, made many like-minded friends, and experienced the charm of programming and the wonderful open-source and social atmosphere in the programmer's world.

I've also achieved some small successes, successively setting up my own CSDN, Zhihu, and WeChat public accounts...

And built my personal website [https://www.sunguoqi.com](https://www.sunguoqi.com)

Technically, I can now independently develop simple web projects.

Ten years ago we gazed at the stars, ten years later we will look down upon the earth. The future sky will surely leave us a brilliant dawn!

> We have been working hard to cultivate such a simple soil. Although we haven't achieved perfection, under everyone's efforts, it has taken initial shape and has gathered many amazing "experts" on the forum!
> Fake it till they make it.
> Finally, as always, Xiaojiayu wishes to grow together with everyone. Ten years ago we gazed at the stars, ten years later we will look down upon the earth. The future sky will surely leave us a brilliant dawn!<br> —— Xiaojiayu, March 2019

May we all live up to our ideals in this world, find our passion, and truly dedicate ourselves to something. As the title of this article says, when you truly want to do something, the whole world will help you.
