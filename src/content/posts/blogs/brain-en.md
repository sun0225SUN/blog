While browsing Github during work breaks, I accidentally discovered this repository.

This repository records the blogger's learning journey from `2020.02.25` to the present. While deeply admiring the blogger, there is a sentence in the `Readme.md` that resonated with me.

> If you only learn without recording anything, it's basically a waste of learning.

I expressed this sentence in another way.

> Any knowledge that has not been processed by your own brain can never truly belong to you.

Learning is human nature.

Each of us engages in a lot of learning activities every day. (Please note, do not narrowly understand "learning" here as attending classes in school.)

Whether it is passive, active, or unconscious learning, when we abstract it to a certain extent, you will find that they all follow the simplest logic.

In the information age, we receive an enormous amount of information every day, but which information is truly internalized as our own knowledge?

I think we should sort it out...

## Building Your Own Second Brain

The "second brain" is also known as the "digital brain" or "external brain". It is a digital information carrier.

You can understand it as a physical entity of a knowledge management system. So what is a knowledge management system?

Here is an article I recommend. It elaborates in detail according to the Golden Circle principle:

- What: What is a knowledge management system?
- Why: Why build a knowledge management system?
- How: How to build our knowledge management system?

## Surviving in the Age of Artificial Intelligence

Recently, with the popularity of chatGPT, artificial intelligence has once again attracted widespread attention.

Will artificial intelligence replace humans?

Similar to human learning behavior, machine learning also follows the simplest logic of `input information` — `process information` — `output information`.

But unlike humans, computers can store vast amounts of information, which humans can never achieve.

We can't help but wonder, how do computers store and manage vast amounts of information?

Putting aside the physical attributes of machines, let's think about this problem from a logical perspective.

Students who have studied the course "Data Structures" must be familiar with the following diagram.

Yes, this is a node in a conventional linked list.

It is worth noting that this node not only contains a data field but also a pointer field.

Because data often does not exist in isolation.

If we organize the data linearly, it will look like this.

In real life, when we encounter a very complex problem, we usually break it down into several sub-problems for analysis.

Data is the same; it should have corresponding levels.

Although we have broken down the problem, its sub-problems may also be interrelated. So, on the basis of hierarchy, we should also ensure the relevance of sub-problems.

Linking vast amounts of information together may seem chaotic, but it is actually orderly. The way computers manage information far exceeds humans.

In terms of storing information, humans can never defeat machines, but perhaps we don't need to.

We should clearly recognize that the human brain is good at thinking and establishing connections, not storing.

Our brain is more like a CPU rather than a hard drive. The existence of the "second brain" is like connecting an external hard drive to the human brain.

In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, in the era of competition between the human brain and artificial intelligence, there may still be an intermediate state, which is `human brain + second brain`.

On `2023.03.24`, I built this website. In the future, it will continuously update my learning and output.

From disorder to order, from fragmentation to structuring, from input to output, when knowledge has completely passed through your brain, I think it will always belong to you!
