<h2>Goodbye, Campus</h2>

<p>As the 2023 postgraduate entrance examination concludes, some are preparing for interviews while others are rushing to submit resumes.</p>
<p>
  At this stage, everyone seems a bit panicked. But facing the uncertainties of the future, we appear powerless.
</p>
<p>For me, I've decided to leave campus and face the uncertainties of the future head-on.</p>

<h2>Hello, "NIO"</h2>

<p>Non-CS major, still an undergraduate, without experiencing the torment of interview questions and algorithms, I arrived at "NIO".</p>
<p>This sounds incredible, but fate indeed brought me here.</p>
<p>Of course, there were people who helped me along the way, but I attribute it to "luck".</p>

<h2>Moving Forward with NIO, Together Towards the Future!</h2>

<p>After working at NIO for a week, I'm certain this is the future I want.</p>

<h2>Happy 22nd Birthday</h2>

  At 22, I will devote myself wholeheartedly to what I love. To refine my character, deepen my technical skills, and create value!

  New York is 3 hours ahead of California, but California is not slow.

Someone graduated at the age of 22, but waited 5 years before securing a good job!

Someone became a CEO at 25, and died at 50.While another became a CEO at 50, and lived to 90 years.

Someone is still single, while someone else got married.

Obama retires at 55, but Trump starts at 70.

Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their Time Zone.

People around you might seem to go ahead of you, some might seem to be behind you. But everyone is running their own RACE, in their own TIME.

Don't envy them or mock them.They are in their TIME ZONE, and you are in yours!

Life is about waiting for the right moment to act.

So, RELAX. You're not LATE. You're not EARLY.

You are very much ON TIME, and in your TIME ZONE Destiny set up for you.
