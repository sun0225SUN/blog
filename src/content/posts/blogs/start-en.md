## Why Did I Clear My Public Account Again

I can't remember the original purpose of registering a public account, but the idea of running it well has never been dismissed.

Why did I clear my public account again?

There are many reasons, but I think the core one is: I am too much of a perfectionist!

### What Kind of Layout Looks Better

Compared to Markdown, rich text editors have a broader beautification space. But precisely because there are too many ways to play, it's harder to start.

Secondly, rich text editors do not support many functions, cannot embed HTML code, cannot elegantly copy and paste, etc.

As a keyboard worker accustomed to using Markdown syntax to record text, suddenly using a rich text editor is like asking an experienced web developer to use Adobe Dreamweaver to write web pages.

It's possible, but really... unnecessary...

### Articles Cannot Be Modified After Publishing

As someone prone to mistakes, after writing an article, there are inevitably some typos or awkward sentences.

But once the article is published, the WeChat public platform only gives the author a chance to modify a few words, which is unbearable for someone with OCD~

### Public Accounts Do Not Have a Comment Function

According to national regulatory requirements, since February 12, 2018, newly registered WeChat public accounts do not have a comment function.

As expected of China, as expected of Tencent.

For self-media, interaction with users is crucial.

Without a comment function, the author cannot get timely feedback from readers, making it difficult to continue improving and growing.

Although it is possible to enable the comment function for personal accounts through other means, the cost is relatively high (not considered for now).

### No Fan Base, No One Reads What I Write

During the preparation for the postgraduate entrance examination, I learned about the concept of **compound interest** in detail.

As shown in the picture above, when we have put in valuable time and done something with great care, but the results are not seen for a long time.

Is it because our efforts are in the wrong direction? Not necessarily.

Quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes. I think it is more because we are not persistent enough.

Secondly, whether writing a personal blog or running a public account, our biggest reader is always ourselves.

In the vast internet, we carve out a small space for ourselves, where we record some daily life, share some insights, and express some troubles, that's all.

## Accepting a 'Shitty' Start

Completion is more important than perfection, and imperfection is also a part of perfection.

When facing something new, it's almost certain that it won't be perfect at the beginning.

If you demand perfection from the start, it's like tying your hands and feet with a rope. How can you move forward?

Accepting a 'shitty' start, I think I can set sail now!
