I scheduled a physical examination for this morning, left at around 7 am, and arrived at the iKang Guobin Zhongguancun branch at around 8 am.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100530499.webp"/>

This should be my first physical examination in recent years, and I was a bit anxious, fearing any abnormal indicators. After getting my number, I first had a blood test, followed by surgical, internal medicine, ECG, chest X-ray, and urinalysis. After completing the general examination, the hospital also provided a complimentary healthy breakfast.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100516175.webp"/>

> The breakfast turned out to be KFC, hahaha, is it to promote that KFC is actually healthy and everyone can eat it with confidence?

## Weight Loss and Health

The physical examination report will be available in the next few days, so today I will first analyze the basic data.

Gender: Male, Age: 23, Height: 169.5 cm, Weight: 77.3 kg, 154.6 lbs, BMI: 26.9, sub-health, in a slightly overweight state.

Let's not talk about height, there is no such height as 169 cm among males, with shoes on, my height is 170+ cm!

Let's focus on weight. On September 10th last year, I weighed 86.8 kg, 173.6 lbs.

I couldn't sleep at night and didn't want to get up during the day. At that time, both my sleep and living conditions were poor. I thought about losing weight but lacked the motivation to act. I was mentally exhausted, and my body showed visible swelling. Seeing this weight, I finally couldn't stand myself and got a gym membership.

With a combination of aerobic and anaerobic exercise and dietary adjustments, I successfully lost 20 lbs in four months.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100521262.webp"/>

<p></p>

Losing weight brings not only physical changes but also positive feedback on life and attitude.

First is sleep. Exercise brings fatigue, and unless you deliberately don't want to sleep, your body will force you to rest under normal circumstances.

Dietary adjustments bring changes from the inside out. Good sleep and hormone regulation make you energetic, more confident, and full of enthusiasm for life.

<blockquote>
Losing 10 lbs changes your appearance; losing 20 lbs changes your confidence; losing 25 lbs changes your temperament; losing 30 lbs changes your life!
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Those who successfully lose weight are often formidable people.

Because they can control their appetite, they know when to stop eating. They can control themselves from eating a lot of everything to eating everything in moderation. Most importantly, they are not influenced by external factors. Anyone who has tried to lose weight knows that there are three major obstacles: family, relatives, and friends (and most importantly, themselves).

- When you eat with your family, they will urge you to eat more.
- When you eat with relatives, they will urge you to stop losing weight.
- When you dine with friends, you will hear, "Is the food not good, or is the drink not tasty? Why do you have to lose weight?"

Those who succeed in losing weight can overcome these obstacles and are truly remarkable.

Moreover, those who succeed in losing weight often have a strong inner strength. They won't give up just because their weight plateaus.

If they also enjoy exercising, they are even more impressive. They can make their bodies move according to their will, even if their exercise time is occupied, they will try to find time.

If they also do strength training, it's even more different. They can endure muscle soreness in different parts of their body each day of the week.

Monday chest workout, chest pain; Tuesday back workout, back pain; Wednesday shoulder workout, shoulder pain; Thursday arm workout, arm pain. Friday is the toughest, leg workout, leg pain; after resting for two days, the cycle repeats next week.

Data shows that the probability of obese men losing weight to normal within a year is only 1/210; for obese women, it is 1/124. The BMI of obese participants in the experiment was in the range of 30-34.9.

Those who succeed in losing weight are destined to be extraordinary! This year's Spring Festival, director Jia Ling's movie "Hot and Spicy" perfectly illustrates this point.

It's not the so-called "survivor bias," I'm talking about those who can truly lose weight successfully, and I've already provided some analysis above.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100545919.webp"/>

## End of Last Year

Losing 20 lbs has brought significant changes to my life (of course, I still need to continue losing weight this year), and I have become more confident and brave.

At the end of last year, I resigned from my job in Guangzhou. I took the Z264 train and set off for Tibet, where I spent more than a week traveling.

After returning home, I spent about five days writing an article, which has received 13,000 views so far (only on WeChat public account).

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8fk4I8JxVHG0vYyJeOXGxg

Bravely escaping, bravely breaking the situation, bravely setting off, bravely facing the unknown, bravely exploring the world, it's not impulsiveness, but true bravery!

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100605574.webp"/>

<blockquote>
<p>"Il n'ya qu'un héroïsme au monde: c'est de voir le monde tel qu'il est et de l'aimer."</p>

"There is only one heroism in the world: to see the world as it is and to love it."

"True heroism is to love life after seeing the truth of it."

<div style="text-align:right">
——Romain Rolland
</div>
</blockquote>

I bravely made decisions and will bravely face all the consequences of those decisions.

The biggest impact is that I need to find a new job.

Before and after the Spring Festival, I spent a lot of time dealing with everything except "job hunting," packed my bags, and was ready to set off again at any time.

## Climbing Mount Tai

February 25th is my Gregorian birthday, and I wanted to leave an unforgettable memory for the first day of my 23rd year. So I decided to climb Mount Tai. Why choose Mount Tai? Why not Huangshan or other places?

First, because Mount Tai is very close to my hometown. It only takes a 50 yuan ticket to get there.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100610089.webp"/>

Second, because of Mount Tai itself. Mount Tai is located in Tai'an, Shandong Province, and is the leader of the Five Sacred Mountains.

The sun rises in the east, and "east" signifies the beginning of all things. A new year, a new age. Setting off again, arriving in a new city, finding a new job, and loving life there...

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100613308.webp"/>

Finally, because of myself. "The road is long, but if you walk, you will reach it; the task is difficult, but if you do it, you will succeed." This is a motto I set for myself when I graduated from university last year.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100614001.webp"/>

Many things are really difficult, but as long as you do them, you will definitely succeed, or at least get satisfactory results. Even if we only achieve 1% of our goal, we have achieved a phased victory.

I want to prove that I can conquer Mount Tai and experience the powerful feedback brought by the internal drive of "walking will reach, doing will succeed."

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100614819.webp"/>

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100615772.webp"/>

After returning to my hometown, I received a book from Uncle Wolf (Volume 1), and there was a passage on the title page:

<blockquote>
<p>"Silently strive to be a more interesting engineer, complain less, think more, and the future will be better!"</p>

<div style="text-align:right">
——Uncle Wolf, 2024.2.24, Beijing
</div>
</blockquote>

I took it as a birthday message for my 23rd birthday.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100617313.webp"/>

## Principle Technology

https://guoxiaoli.com/post/548.html

Everything is the best arrangement. The night before climbing Mount Tai, I saw a job posting on a social platform.

<img width="40%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100618031.webp"/>

When I saw this job posting, I was very excited. Isn't this prepared for me?

<img width="40%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100619589.webp"/>

<img width="40%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100619618.webp"/>

I originally planned to start preparing for the "spring recruitment" after climbing Mount Tai, so the plan was to contact this CEO (now my boss) after climbing Mount Tai.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100620589.webp"/>

But... as I continued to learn and input the mission and values of "Principle Technology," I couldn't hold back anymore.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100620541.webp"/>

Such an opportunity is rare, if not now, when?

I directly added Xiaoli's WeChat (about the address: Xiaoxue told me that this is a culture inherited from ByteDance, where you are not allowed to call someone \*\*brother/sister in the company, you can directly call their name, aiming to convey the idea of equality for everyone). We had a brief chat and scheduled an interview time.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100621905.webp"/>

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100621700.webp"/>

Morning interview, afternoon offer, I didn't even prepare a resume at that time, but everything went so smoothly. Everything is the best arrangement.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100623148.webp"/>

## One Week of Employment

I arrived in Beijing on the morning of March 1, 2024, which was last Friday.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100625054.webp"/>

The main task on the first day in Beijing was to find a place to live. Unexpectedly, I found a place in the morning.

After a short rest, in the evening, I went to the shopping mall to buy a quilt and some necessary daily necessities, and then continued to rest.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100625814.webp"/>

The next day, I made an appointment with a friend (a university classmate who is studying for a master's degree nearby) to explore Beijing and see where I will be working in the future.

<img width="40%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100626309.webp"/>

Beijing's architecture is magnificent, I really love this city.

<img width="60%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100628315.webp"/>

On Sunday afternoon, I planned to familiarize myself with the surrounding environment and check the route to work.

Coincidentally, I happened to meet Cellinlab, who had just finished talking with Xiaoli and wanted to chat with me.

<img width="60%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100629276.webp"/>

From noon to 4 pm, we talked a lot about the past and the future.

<img width="60%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100629678.webp"/>

<img width="60%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100629191.webp"/>

I really love the heating, I slept very well in Beijing these few nights. Why doesn't northern Anhui have heating? Every winter, we have to suffer from magical attacks.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100630453.webp"/>

On Monday, I walked 6.6 km and successfully arrived at the company at 9:57 am (the agreed time to complete the onboarding procedures was 10:00 am).

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100630085.webp"/>

Yes, I walked. Why did I choose to walk? Because I wanted to experience this journey in the most primitive way.

On the first day at the company, Miaomiao helped me register my personal information. In the afternoon, I spent time reading the company's "knowledge base."

<blockquote>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;This society does not lack tools, nor does it lack professionals. What is lacking are people with a skill and a global perspective. It's okay if you don't know something, we can learn. If you don't learn, you have no skills, and without skills, how can you stand?</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;I hope you can truly understand that here, there are no bosses, only classmates. We are just working together, and everyone is responsible for the company as well as their own growth, working to improve their abilities.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;If we all live according to societal constraints and maintain life through inertia, then... this world would be really boring.</p>

https://blog.sunguoqi.com/posts/a8bf3922

We are starting a business, not just working. The text in the image below is a passage I wrote in my 2023 "Year-End Summary."

<img width="60%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100635058.webp"/>

I must declare that this viewpoint is not my original. But fortunately, I got this point when I first entered the workplace last year.

<img width="60%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100636087.webp"/>

If you see someone with a backpack in Shangdi (Shangdi in Beijing, a paradise for coders), please note that they are probably not students, but very likely internet people (most likely programmers)!

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100636201.webp"/>

No bosses, only classmates. When I use the online name "Xiao Sun Classmate" to socialize, I also mean this.

Although I have graduated from university, I will always be a student because "live and learn."

Principle Technology's values completely match mine. Xiaoli's past projects, ProcessOn and Mubu, are two of my favorite products.

<img width="60%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100637275.webp"/>

Xiaoli and I get along very well, and I share almost all my thoughts with him. However, there is one thing he definitely doesn't know (of course, he knows now):

In my past world blueprint, my goal was to enter a big company within three years, and the big company I particularly wanted to join was ByteDance.

ByteDance, let the bytes dance! Eight bits, one byte (coincidentally, Principle Technology currently has eight classmates: Xiaoli, Xiaoxue, Chaichai, Miaomiao, Xinyu, Chuanmin, Linxiang, and me). Daily meetings, product research, user feedback, feature feedback... every customer, every document, every word, every project, every file, every function, every line of code, every bit... constitutes the current Principle Technology.

Why is our company called Principle Technology? Xiaoli wrote:

<blockquote>
<p>Whether it's being a person, doing things, or running a company, we should follow some basic principles to reduce mistakes. At the same time, we should learn more and practice more to possibly reach the end.</p>

<div style="text-align:right">
——Guo Xiaoli "Introduction to Principle Technology & Guo Xiaoli"
</div>
</blockquote>

I completely agree.

Xiaoli told me that our goal this time is not just to make tools, but to make products.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100649807.webp"/>

<blockquote>
<p>Principle Technology aims to serve freelancers, making software for them to help improve their work and earning efficiency.</p>

<div style="text-align:right">
——Guo Xiaoli "Recruiting Entrepreneurial Partners - 20240221"
</div>
</blockquote>

Xiaoli wrote in his blog:

<blockquote>
<p>I am an ordinary person, I don't want to work, I chose to start a business, I know most people don't want to work either,</p>

They don't want to look at their boss's face, they don't want to write work reports, they don't want endless meetings, they don't want to do things they don't like day after day.

Some of them have already started to wake up, trying hard, starting to support themselves by making Douyin, Bilibili, and Xiaohongshu.

They are warriors, they dare to break the norm, dare to be self-reliant.

They fail again and again, try again and again, at first their income is very low, they persist because of interest.

I want to make tools for them, do my best to help them, I have also come this way, tried several times, I am relatively lucky.

<div style="text-align:right">
——Guo Xiaoli "Recruiting Entrepreneurial Partners - 20240221"
</div>
</blockquote>

I can get the mission of Principle (if I hadn't joined Principle Technology, I might have become a freelancer/independent developer in the next five or seven years), and this is exactly what I want to do.

Today is my seventh day officially joining Principle Technology, and I feel like I have my own career, and I am fighting for my career.

Netizens say I look like I'm in love! Well, why not~

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100651230.webp"/>

Unconsciously, I have written so many words (of course, not really written, but typed with a keyboard. Oh, by the way, my keyboard model is: NuPhy Air75 V2 Basalt Black Cranberry Switch).

## Returning to Life

After talking about work, let's return to life.

The place where I had my physical examination today is next to Peking University, and next to Peking University is Tsinghua University.

To experience this land up close, after the physical examination, I decided to walk around here.

The destination is the second gate of Tsinghua University. While walking, looking at the students, a joke came to my mind.

<blockquote>
<p>Question: Little friend, do you want to go to Tsinghua or Peking University in the future?</p>
<p>Answer: Tsinghua, if I do well, I want to become the head of the security team.</p>
</blockquote>

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100654603.webp"/>

<p></p>
The gap in cognition and environment creates the diversity of society, and we live in a huge gap.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100657326.webp"/>

<blockquote>
<p>"The imbalance between regions, the imbalance in economic development, the imbalance in personal life, and finally even the imbalance in dreams."</p>

——Yu Hua "We Live in a Huge Gap"
</div>
</blockquote>

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100658243.webp"/>

## Talking About Reading

Yu Hua (nickname: Careless Puppy) is a writer I really like.

But to my shame, I have only watched the movie "To Live" directed by Zhang Yimou and have not read any of his written works.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100659351.webp"/>

I like Yu Hua partly because of his contrast.

<blockquote>
<p>"Leave the sadness to the readers, leave the joy to yourself. (Optimized version by Yu Hua: Leave the sadness to fiction, leave the joy to reality.)"</p>
</blockquote>

I have watched many interviews with Yu Hua online, and I like his humor, his clear views, and his attitude towards life.

## Walking with Hui

Oh, speaking of Yu Hua, I can't help but think of Zhongguancun Jay Chou - Dong Yuhui.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100701314.webp"/>

Teacher Dong and Careless Puppy have had two interactions, the most recent one was on February 28, 2024, in the "Walking with Hui" live broadcast room, with guests including Teacher Su Tong and Editor-in-Chief of "Harvest" magazine, Cheng Yongxin.

<blockquote>
<p>"At that time, we had dreams, about literature, about love, about traveling across the world."</p>

<div style="text-align:right">
——Bei Dao "Polish Visitor"
</div>
</blockquote>

I started following Teacher Dong when he first became popular, on June 9, 2022.

I am a very distinct science student, but for a while, I positioned myself as: a rational romanticist!

Romantic is imaginative, rational is down-to-earth. I have learned a lot, thought about many issues, inspired many ideas, and practiced many values in the "Oriental Selection/Walking with Hui" live broadcast room.

Teacher Dong is my reading enlightenment, he speaks eloquently, and small essays come easily. From him, I felt the power of reading, the power of culture.

## About Photography

<blockquote>
<p>Photography is the art of using light - using up money!</p>
</blockquote>

Beijing is very clean, and the scenery is beautiful. A casual shot is a masterpiece. It seems that the plan to buy a camera needs to be put on the agenda.

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100703967.webp"/>

For a long time, I have been struggling with a question:

Should I save more money to buy a full-frame mirrorless camera, or directly buy a relatively cheaper APS-C half-frame camera?

<img width="50%" src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100704243.webp"/>

Just when I was struggling with this question again today, a short video I had seen before suddenly came to mind.

But I didn't remember it very clearly, maybe I just sighed a little and swiped away when I saw it.

With the keyword "if you can't afford a pound, buy half a pound," I searched online and found the full version of this video.

{% note info flat %}https://v.douyin.com/iFMJrSsu/ Copy this link, open Douyin to search, and watch the video directly!{% endnote %}

A family went on a trip, and when buying tickets, the mother spent an extra 482 yuan to buy a first-class seat.

The daughter couldn't understand this behavior. In her opinion, the second-class seat is not unbearable, so why spend so much more money to buy a first-class seat?

So, she expressed her doubts to her mother.

However, the mother told her, "How can you have such an idea? You should know that you deserve a first-class seat, you are worth a first-class seat."

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BcCIhXW6nX7AFTWbbX2U3Q

......

<blockquote>
<p>You want to eat cherries, but when you go to the supermarket, you find that a pound of cherries can buy a box of apples, so you foolishly carry a box of apples home.</p>
<p>You want to eat cherries, so you buy cherries. If you can't afford a pound, buy half a pound, instead of thinking that you only deserve cheap apples.</p>
<p>Remember, you deserve the best, to wear the best, to use the best. Of course, the premise is that you are also working hard for it. You deserve all the good things in this world!</p>
</blockquote>

My eyes are tearing up...

I no longer struggle with buying a full-frame or half-frame camera. If I can't afford a "pound," I can buy "half a pound" first.

At the same time, I use this half-frame mirrorless camera to tell myself that I deserve all the good things in this world.

Leave everything to time, young people are not afraid of long years, there is still glory on the other side, do good deeds, and don't ask about the future~

<img src="https://assets.guoqi.dev/images/202403100706100.webp"/>

## Epilogue

Today, I originally just wanted to record my physical examination experience, but I didn't expect to write so much.

In one night, thousands of words, dozens of pictures. I shared my story, my thoughts, and my growth experience with you.

In the future, I hope we can both become better versions of ourselves, and I hope we can both focus wholeheartedly and do what we love without reservation, putting all our passion into our careers and lives.
